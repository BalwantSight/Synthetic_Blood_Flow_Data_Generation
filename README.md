# Synthetic Blood Flow Data Generation

## Description
This project aims to generate synthetic data related to blood flow, considering physiological and pathological conditions. A simulation based on biomedical parameters is used to create a dataset that includes information about vessel diameter, pressure, blood viscosity, hematocrit, and other relevant factors.

## Features
- Generation of synthetic blood flow data.
- Visualization of distributions and correlations between variables using graphs.
- Statistical analysis of the generated data.

## Requirements
Make sure to have the following dependencies installed to run this project:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Installation
You can install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py
